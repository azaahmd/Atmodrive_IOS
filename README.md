Manual Testing of a Drive Application

Manual testing of a drive application involves systematically evaluating the application by executing test cases without the use of automation tools. The goal is to ensure the functionality, usability, and performance of the application meet the specified requirements.

Preparation
Requirement Analysis: Understand the application's purpose, features, and expected user interactions. Gather documentation such as requirement specifications, use cases, and user stories.
Test Environment Setup: Prepare the environment where the testing will be conducted. This includes installing the application on various devices (PCs, tablets, smartphones) and ensuring that the necessary permissions
and settings are configured.

Test Planning
Test Case Design: Develop detailed test cases based on the application's requirements. Each test case should have:
Test Case ID: Unique identifier for each test case.
Test Description: Brief description of what the test will validate.
Preconditions: Any setup required before executing the test.
Test Steps: Step-by-step instructions to perform the test.
Expected Results: The expected outcome for each step.
Actual Results: The outcome observed after executing the test.
Status: Pass or fail indication.
